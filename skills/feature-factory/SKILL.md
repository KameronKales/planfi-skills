  Autonomously research product gaps and ship them end-to-end. Invoke when someone says "find

  Definition of Done, hang-proof tests, keep-awake, crash/rate-limit recovery, and progress updates.

# Feature Factory — autonomous research → build → ship

A repeatable, hands-off loop: **discover the highest-value gaps in a product, then build and ship
each one** across engine, tests, UI, API/MCP, and distribution — to a fixed Definition of Done,
with the resilience needed to run unattended (e.g. overnight).

It's two saved workflows plus an orchestration the assistant runs in its main loop. Don't reinvent
it each time — invoke this skill.

## Inputs (all optional)
- **how many** gaps to build this run (default: all that research surfaces, highest-value first)
- **focus** area for research (default: the whole product surface)
- **exclude** already-built/in-flight slugs
- **updates channel** (a chat webhook) for progress — read it from your memory/config, never hardcode

## Step 0 — Arm resilience (once per run)
1. **Keep-awake:** start `caffeinate -dimsu -t 43200` in the background (macOS) so the machine
   doesn't sleep and pause workflows/schedulers.
2. **Hang-proof tests:** ensure `scripts/safe-jest.sh` exists and that every workflow runs tests
   through it (hard wall-clock timeout + `--forceExit --runInBand`) — **never bare `npx jest`**,
   which can hang and silently block the whole run.
3. **Watchdog:** schedule a recurring check (~every 20 min, off the :00/:30 marks). Each fire,
   idempotently: if a build has run too long → suspect a test hang, stop it, **verify the code
   yourself with safe-jest**, and continue; advance the queue; on token rate-limits **back off** and
   retry next cycle (never hammer); flag any blocked prod step and move on; when done, clean up
   (delete the watchdog, stop caffeinate).

## Step 1 — Research the gaps (structured)
Run `Workflow({ name: 'research-gaps', args: { exclude, focus } })`. It returns a build-ready list:
`{ gaps: [ { slug, name, description, audience, evidence, recommended_tool, distribution, skill_route, scope, priority } ] }`.
Post the ranked gap list to the updates channel. Track the queue as tasks (one per gap).

## Step 2 — Build each gap (sequential)
Gaps share files, so build **one at a time**, highest priority first. For each:
1. Write + commit its spec from `docs/FEATURE_PLAYBOOK.md` (auto-apply its decisions:
   `distribution`/`scope` from the gap object).
2. Run `Workflow({ name: 'build-gap', args: <the gap object> })` — engine+tests → (MCP ∥ web+homepage)
   → distribution, all tests via safe-jest, to the Playbook's Definition of Done.
3. **Ship** (main loop): read the verify verdicts, run the suites yourself via safe-jest + a web
   build, fix anything flagged, commit, create/sync the distribution repo(s) + catalog, merge, deploy.
4. Post a progress update; mark the task done; take the next gap.

## Step 3 — Finish
When the queue is empty (or the budget is spent), post a summary of what shipped (and anything
partial — never mark partial work "done"), then tear down resilience (stop the watchdog + caffeinate).

## Definition of Done (per gap)
Defined once in `docs/FEATURE_PLAYBOOK.md`: pure reusable **engine** (+ reference-validated tests to
the coverage gate), **web** integration (progressive disclosure + dedicated panel + wired into the
forecast + **homepage feature-list update** + e2e), a **self-orchestrating** API/MCP tool, and
**distribution** (a skill in its repo + the catalog, or folded into an existing skill). Fictional
examples only; no secrets in shared artifacts.

## Guardrails
- **Sequential builds** (shared files) · **safe-jest only** · **back off on rate limits** ·
  **never mark partial work complete** · **surface assumptions, not silent defaults** ·
  **keep secrets (webhooks/tokens) in config/memory**, never in committed or shared files.
